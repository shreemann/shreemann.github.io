In this post, I walk through how I built a behavioural scorecard using 3,500+ bureau and banking features for SME customers.

### Techniques used:

- Feature clustering
- Reject inference
- Model validation across train/test/OOT

### Impact:
- ðŸ“ˆ Gini improved by 12%
- ðŸ’° â‚¹500 Cr disbursal uplift
