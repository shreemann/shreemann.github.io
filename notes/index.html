			A visual stack of my messy notes
		</p>
		<p class='intro__bod'>
			Since '17, I have been writing down tips and tricks on brown tinted notebooks, outlines of old xerox pages and every notes app I came across.
			These were passed down by random youtube videos, colleagues, mentors and a few failed experiments. 
			<span class='tooltip'>*<span class="tooltiptext">By a few, I mean A LOT.</span></span>.

			<br><br>
			Needless to say, it was long overdue that I compiled everything I have to something I call more organized than my desk. 
			In case of anything erraneous, stumble over to my socials and I'll undeniably amend it!
